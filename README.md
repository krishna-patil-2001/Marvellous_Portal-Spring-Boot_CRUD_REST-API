# Mavellous Portal — Spring Boot CRUD REST API
Mavellous Portal is a Spring Boot–based full-stack backend application built using Lombok and MongoDB.

Project Overview

  *  Mavellous Portal is a Spring Boot–based full-stack backend application built using Lombok and MongoDB.
  *  This project demonstrates how to build and manage a complete CRUD REST API (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing entities in a structured and scalable way.
  *  It follows clean architecture principles, reduces boilerplate code using Lombok, and integrates MongoDB for data persistence.

Technology Stack:
  *  Spring Boot — backend framework for RESTful APIs.
  *  Lombok — to reduce boilerplate code (getters, setters, constructors).
  *  MongoDB — NoSQL database for fast and flexible data storage.
  *  Spring Data MongoDB — for seamless database integration.
  *  Maven — for project build and dependency management.

Features:

  *  CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
  *  RESTful API Endpoints.
  *  MongoDB Integration with Repository Layer.
  *  Entity Mapping using Lombok Annotations.
  *  Error Handling and Response Entity Implementation.
  *  Clean and Scalable Code Structure.

Learning Outcomes:

  *  Hands-on Experience with Spring Boot framework for backend development.
  *  Practical understanding of MongoDB and NoSQL data modeling.
  *  Exposure to REST API design and client-server architecture.
  *  Strong Application of backend development with CRUD operation.
